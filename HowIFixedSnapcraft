When I was trying to make the SNAP, when I tried to run SNAPCRAFT it said that
the address was already taken, was port 53 taken? DNSmasq had this error.

But when I looked at the processes watching Port53, dnsmasq was one of them!

After a day or two of trying to figure it out, I realized that since DNSmasq was hogging DNSmasq's port, what about uninstalling it but keeping DNSmasq-base?

So I ran :

$ sudo apt remove dnsmasq

And it removed DNSmasq but not DNSmasq's base, and it worked !

(Just in case anyone had the same problem.)
